    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>
    As you already know, I am Jan De Andrade Huss. Born to a Brazilian mother and a German father,
    I was raised in Brasília, Brazil. There, I graduated from high school and attended one semester 
    of a Nutrition course at the University of Brasília (UNB).
</p>

<p>    
    At the age of 17, after passing the admission exam for the University of Brasília, 
    I enrolled as a nutrition science student.However, it became clear to me from the beginning 
    that the course was not suitable for me.
    One of the deciding factors was my lack of maturity.
</p>

<p>
    Consequently, I abandoned the course and, being a German citizen, 
    moved to the cold region of the Black Forest (Schwarzwald), 
    where I completed an apprenticeship in mechatronics.
</p>

<p>
    Upon successfully completing my apprenticeship, I was determined to deepen my knowledge in the field.
    Fortunately, I found an opportunity to study Mechatronics at the 
    University of Applied Sciences of Koblenz, Germany.
